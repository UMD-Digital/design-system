The University of Maryland's Design System is intended for use by university campus entities and partners. The packages prompt consistency in brand, design, and accessibility compliance across university web properties.

## Packages

The design system consists of the following packages, listed in dependency order:

### Foundation Layer

- **[Icons](packages/icons/README.md)** (`v1.0.0`): SVG icon and logo assets organized by category for optimal tree-shaking. Includes navigation, controls, social media, brand assets, and UMD logos.

- **[Utilities](packages/utilities/README.md)** (`v0.1.0`): Shared utility functions organized into 14 categories: accessibility, adapters, animation, date, DOM manipulation, elements, events, media, network, performance, storage, string processing, style utilities, and validation. Includes 100% test coverage and comprehensive TypeDoc documentation.

- **[Styles](packages/styles/README.md)** (`v1.6.9`): JSS objects, design tokens, and style utilities consistent with UMD brand guidelines. Includes colors, typography, spacing, media queries, and layout patterns.

### Component Layer

- **[Elements](packages/elements/README.md)** (`v1.4.8`): Foundational UI element builders that create consistent, accessible HTML structures. Includes atomic components (typography, actions, media) and composite components (cards, navigation, tabs, sliders).

- **[Feeds](packages/feeds/README.md)** (`v1.1.1`): Dynamic content feed components for displaying news articles, events, testimonials, and data visualizations from various data sources.
