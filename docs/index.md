# University of Maryland Design System

The University of Maryland's Design System is intended for use by university campus entities and partners. The packages of Web Components, styles and feeds prompt consistency in brand, design, and accessibility compliance. The web components package contains common UI elements for interfaces, interactivity, layout, and data feeds. The theme package has consistent classes for typography, layout, and common UI elements like rich text.
