              ONE EVENING IN FEBRUARY 2021, Janaria Muhammad stepped out of her
              house in Knoxville, Tenn., to meet friends at her favorite
              restaurant, Kings and Wings. Recently turned 15, Nana, as everyone
              called her, was a perpetual source of energy for those around her.
              She reminded her brothers to keep their grades up, helped her dad
              navigate new technology so much that he teased she was his
              secretary, shimmied with the dance team at Austin-East High
              School, and babysat neighborhood kids and cut hair for pocket
              money.
            </p>
            <p>
              “She was like the sun,” her father, Lawrence Muhammad, told The
              Washington Post. “When you saw her, you lit up.”
            </p>
            <p>
              That night, Nana didn’t make it past her yard on Selma Avenue
              before the darkness got her: She was hit twice by a drive-by
              shooter. Her father rushed outside and held her as she died—the
              third of five Austin-East students lost to gun violence before the
              end of spring.
            </p>
            <p>
              To mark the second anniversary of Nana’s murder, dozens gathered
              outside the squat brick building that houses East Knoxville’s YWCA
              Phyllis Wheatley Center, where she regularly came after school to
              do homework, play basketball and snap pictures with friends.
              Friends and relatives, along with community members and leaders,
              clutched purple balloons—the color she’d chosen for her
              bedroom—under a gray, oatmeal-textured sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her parents spoke to news cameras, pleading again for help finding
              her still-unidentified killer. “If we don’t get justice in this
              life, we know that we will get justice in the next,” said
              Jacquelinne Muhammad, Nana’s mother.

            <p>
              Confronted with 40 other homicides that year and desperate to lead
              her city to a safer future, Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon picked
              up a book that promised a straightforward approach to reducing gun
              crime: “Bleeding Out: The Devastating Consequences of Urban
              Violence—And a Bold New Plan for Peace.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In it, author Thomas Abt, a University of Maryland associate
              research professor, delivers a set of evidence-based action items:
              focus a range of prevention efforts on those likeliest to be
              perpetrators or victims; keep a closer eye on areas likeliest to
              experience violence; and employ people who know the world of
              street violence intimately to act as mediators.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Kincannon read the book, she was struck by the feeling that “it
              was written for mayors,” she says. “It’s research-based, but it’s
              also very, very practical.” She emailed Abt to ask him more about
              his ideas, laying the groundwork for what’s becoming a central
              part of the city’s anti-violence strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knoxville is the first city to partner with Abt’s Center for the
              Study and Practice of Violence Reduction, or VRC. Formed shortly
              after his arrival at UMD’s Department of Criminology and Criminal
              Justice, the center, funded partly by the private philanthropy
              organization Arnold Ventures, seeks to conduct research on
              minimizing gun violence, and to offer its expertise for free to
              municipalities around the country. Partnerships with other cities,
              including Boston, are in the works.

              “The mission is very simple,” says Abt. “We want to save lives by
              stopping violence, using science. As we measure our progress, that
              will be the question: Have we saved lives?”

              KNOXVILLE POLICE OFFICER Conner Wiesenberg has the kind of “how’s
              your dad doing?” familiarity with neighborhood regulars that Abt
              prizes, because it opens doors for peaceful solutions to problems
              that could escalate to bullets flying. He graduated from Knoxville
              Central High, and played on its basketball team with kids from
              Lonsdale, a neighborhood that experienced violence then, too. “It
              would not be uncommon for us to be on a traffic stop and somebody
              rolls by, calls my name out, it’s somebody that I know,” he says.

                partner, Andrell Cummings, point out a small square of pavement
                where someone has spray-painted a design, including the word
                “Pache,” the nickname of a neighborhood resident accidentally
                shot and killed last May during a dispute he’d been trying to
                defuse.

                Knoxville and cities around America are increasingly littered
                with symbols of tragedy. In 2020, amid a pandemic, political
                toxicity and civic upheaval, the U.S. reached a startling new
                peak: 79% of murders involved a gun, the highest since at least
                1968, according to the Pew Research Center. Other numbers also
                painted an unsettling picture: In 2021, the nonprofit Gun
                Violence Archive recorded the most gun deaths, 45,107, since its
                2013 founding.

          <div class="umd-rich-text umd-layout-vertical-interior-child">
            <p>
              While suicides and domestic violence make up a significant number
              of gun deaths, Abt’s focus is urban or community violence, defined
              in “Bleeding Out” as occurring “outside the home, on the streets
              or in other public spaces where people congregate.” Muggings gone
              too far, gang rivalries, personal disputes that play out in
              parking lots or on street corners—those are his terrain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knoxville, a hilly city of roughly 190,000, outstrips most other
              U.S. cities of its size in rising violence. In 2022, its homicide
              rate was 21.4 per 100,000, more than double in 2018 and roughly
              triple 2022’s national rate. While U.S. cities saw a 30% increase
              in homicides from 2019 to 2020, Knoxville’s surged 68%.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2022, Kincannon, in conjunction with the Knoxville Police
              Department, hired Abt (then chair of the Violent Crime Working
              Group at the think tank Counsel on Criminal Justice) and other
              experts to analyze gun violence in the city, determining who and
              what was fueling it and recommending policies to reduce it.

              President Gregory Washington to focus research expertise at the
